# Mini-TT
- This is a mirror of http://www.cse.chalmers.se/research/group/logic/Mini-TT/. I modify the haskell codes to compile current GHC (on Jan 2017).
- The paper is here. http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~bengt/papers/GKminiTT.pdf
- You can build this project with stack using `./build.sh` (it works with git-bash on Windows)
- There's an IntelliJ plugin for this language: https://github.com/owo-lang/intellij-dtlc
